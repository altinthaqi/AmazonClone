# AmazonClone

Deployed version: https://clone-882dc.web.app

AmazonClone is a ReactJS web application I built following a 9 hour tutorial on youtube of "Clever Programmer".
This project was challenging but I enjoyed building it.

The project covers an entire E-Commerce solution. From Designing, Authentication till Payment.

The tech used for this project was HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, React Context API, Firebase.
